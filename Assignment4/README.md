# How to run:

Compile with stack build in the directory

and then stack test with the test files


# Notes:

I mostly used git copilot and modified the code that it generated as we had done in the lecture. Following the readme helped and also creating some of the basic test files, though I found the existing test files to be substantial enough for my uses.
